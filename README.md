# Rag-Based-Information-Retrieval
A fully local application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate answers strictly from the provided documents. If information is not found, the system refuses to answer, preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliable, trustworthy results.
